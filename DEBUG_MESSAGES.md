# Debugging Messages Page

## The Problem
Messages page shows "Failed to load conversations. Please try again later."

## Applied Changes

### 1. Fix API Endpoint
- **Before:** `/api/chat/user/${userId}`
- **After:** `/api/chat/user/chats`

### 2. Add Debugging
- Console logs in `api.ts` to track requests and responses
- Console logs in `Messages.tsx` to track user and token
- Console logs in `fetchChats` function

## How to Debug

### 1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
### 2. Check the Console for the following logs:

```
Environment Info:
- REACT_APP_API_URL: ...
- Current URL: ...
- Hostname: ...
- Origin: ...

API URL: ...

Messages component - User: ...
Messages component - Token: ...

Adding token to request: /api/chat/user/chats
Fetching chats for user: ...
```

### 3. Check the Network Tab
- Look at the request to `/api/chat/user/chats`
- Check the Authorization header
- Look at the response status

## Possible Causes of the Problem

### 1. Authentication Problem
- Token not found in localStorage
- Token expired
- Token incorrect

### 2. API URL Problem
- API URL incorrect
- Server not running on correct port

### 3. Server Problem
- Server not running
- Database connection problem
- Route handler problem

## Solutions

### If token is missing:
1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Check `localStorage.getItem('token')`

### If API URL is incorrect:
1. Check console.log('API URL:', API_URL)
2. Make sure the server is running on the correct port

### If server doesn't respond:
1. Check that the server is running
2. Check the database connection
3. Look at the server logs
